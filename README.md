# so_long

And thanks for the fish!

# Goal

Make a little game
- Read a map file
- Check if the map is correct
  - The map should be a rectangle
  - The map should have one spawn point, one exit and at least one coin / point
  - The map should be closed by walls
  - Every coin should be reached by the player
- Display the map
- Move the player
- Of course the game should not have any sort of leak

# Bonus part

I didn't made any bonus as I was running out of time. I tried FdF before and after two weeks I gave up and switched to so_long.

# My thoughts on the project

If only I initially started with so_long instead of FdF ! I would have made the bonus part if not more. Other than that, that project was really fun to do, the parsing of the map was a bit tideous but the actual game part was easier and it was fun to do.
